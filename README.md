# use-partial-store / usePartialStore
use-partial-store (or usePartialStore) is a small TypeScript utility that lets you select only the parts of an object you care about — using a familiar "attribute.subattribute.nextsubattribute" dot-path syntax — while keeping full type safety and IDE autocompletion.
